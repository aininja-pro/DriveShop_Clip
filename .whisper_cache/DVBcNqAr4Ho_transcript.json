{"video_id": "DVBcNqAr4Ho", "transcript": "When you climb the ladder of Toyota's off-road truck lineup, the top rung rests at TRD Pro. Short for Toyota Racing Development, TRD Pro vehicles are aimed squarely at the most dedicated, adventure-seeking, off-road driving, work-hard, play-hard enthusiasts. Toyota offers the TRD Pro models for Tundra and 4Runner and now for the 2nd time, the next-generation Tacoma. It stands out with its heritage-inspired Toyota front grille but this is not just a poser. This Tacoma is designed to perform in the toughest off-road environments. Based off of the TRD Off-Road 4x4 Double Cab Shortbed model, the Pro adds 16-inch TRD Black Alloys, Wrangler All-Terrain Kevlar Reinforced Tires, a TRD Tuned Suspension with a 1-inch lift in the front and progressive-rate off-road leaf springs in the rear, box shocks, front skid plate, LED fog lights, projector beam headlights, a standard V6 tow package and a host of exterior and interior aesthetic upgrades. Additional off-road technology includes a locking rear differential, Hill Start Assist Control, Clutch Start Cancel on manual transmission models, Active Traction Control and Crawl Control. For automatic transmission-equipped models, a Multi-Terrain Select system allows the driver to choose between different types of terrain such as loose rock or mud and sand. Each input regulates wheel spin by adjusting throttle and brake pressure to provide maximum traction on almost any terrain. The pricing starts at $41,920 which includes a 278-horsepower V6 and 6-speed manual rated at 18mpg in combined driving. The 6-speed automatic is optional.", "timestamp": "2025-08-11T22:34:35.189255"}
