{"video_id": "0Y79RlOoENg", "transcript": "Hi everyone, this week we are talking about the 2025 Audi Q7. This is Audi's full-size, three-row luxury crossover that seats up to seven passengers. Prices for this model start right around $60,000 for the base model, but they can get as high as over $92,000 when it's fully optioned out. This one here is the Prestige Package and checks in right under $89,000, but let's hop inside and check out five things you should know. The first thing of note is the 2025 Q7 received a refreshed exterior design with a more refined front grille, new LED headlights, and revised front bumpers. These updates give the Q7 a more modern and aggressive look, aligning with Audi's latest design language. The vehicle's overall shape remains sleek and aerodynamic, but these tweaks give it a sharper, more premium presence on the road. The Q7 does offer two engine choices, including a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and a more powerful 3.0-liter V6 with a mild hybrid technology. The V6 engine produces 335 horsepower, provides smooth acceleration, and ample power for highway cruising. This system helps improve fuel efficiency and provides a smoother driving experience, especially during stop-and-go traffic. The mild hybrid setup is optimizing power delivery and reduces fuel consumption without compromising any Audi performance. Audi's Quattro all-wheel drive system comes standard, ensuring excellent traction and stability in various driving conditions. The Q7's suspension is well-tuned for comfort and refinement, offering a smooth ride over various road conditions. With adaptive air suspension available, the Q7 can adjust its ride height for better handling or increased comfort. The precise steering and responsive handling contribute to an enjoyable driving experience, making it both a practical and enjoyable vehicle for families. Hopping inside, the Q7 offers a luxurious cabin with features such as a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, a 10.1-inch touchscreen with MMI touch response, and a 730-watt Bang & Olufsen premium sound system. New for 2025, the Q7 supports third-party apps like Spotify, Amazon Music, and YouTube through the Audi App Store, which further enhances media access and connectivity. The interior of the Q7 features a minimalist, upscale design with high-quality materials and finishes. It accommodates up to seven passengers across three rows. It comes standard with 12-way power-adjustable front seats with available ventilation and massaging functions. Seated front seats come standard, and rear seats are also available with heating functions. There is a tri-zone automatic climate control standard, and an available four-zone system is available in higher trims. Premium upholstery options include leather seating surfaces with higher trims offering Volcana Cricut leather. Other options include gray-brown fine-grain ash-natural wood inlays in various leather upholstery colors. The Q7 comes exclusively with a bench in the second row that does split and fold forward to provide access to the third row. That third row is pretty tight and best suited for younger children. It does recline slightly to enhance comfort, but is best for shorter trips and not ideal for a longer road trip. For further customization inside your Q7, Audi has introduced a unique personalization feature called Audi Themes, which allows owners of select models, including the Q7, to customize their vehicle's interior ambience to reflect their favorite major league soccer team. In celebration of the MLS All-Star Games, Audi launched this branded theme for all 29 MLS clubs. Owners can apply these themes to their multimedia interface display, which transforms the screen with club-specific wallpapers. And then for vehicles equipped with the optional LED interior lighting package plus, the ambient lighting can be synchronized to complement the chosen wallpaper to further enhance the immersive experience. The Q7 offers a reasonable amount of cargo space with 14.2 cubic feet behind the third row, 35.7 cubic feet behind the second row with the third row folded flat, and 69.6 cubic feet with both the second and third rows folded flat. Other bonus features are that the third row has power folding capability that allows for easy reconfiguration of the seating at the touch of a button, and there's also a power hands-free liftgate in the back.
