-- ========================================
-- CLEAR SUPABASE DATABASE FOR CLEAN TESTING
-- ========================================
-- This script completely clears all data from the DriveShop Clip Tracking database
-- while preserving the table structure and relationships.
-- 
-- USE WITH CAUTION: This will permanently delete ALL data!
-- 
-- To run this in Supabase:
-- 1. Go to your Supabase project
-- 2. Navigate to SQL Editor
-- 3. Copy and paste this entire script
-- 4. Click "Run" to execute
-- ========================================

-- Start transaction for safety
BEGIN;

-- Disable foreign key checks temporarily for faster deletion
SET session_replication_role = replica;

-- ========== CLEAR ALL DATA ==========
-- Delete in order to respect foreign key constraints

-- 1. Clear clips table first (has foreign key to processing_runs)
DELETE FROM clips;

-- 2. Clear wo_tracking table (independent)
DELETE FROM wo_tracking;

-- 3. Clear processing_runs table last (referenced by clips)
DELETE FROM processing_runs;

-- Re-enable foreign key checks
SET session_replication_role = DEFAULT;

-- ========== RESET SEQUENCES (if any) ==========
-- Note: UUID primary keys don't use sequences, so no reset needed

-- ========== VERIFICATION ==========
-- Check that all tables are empty
