            <div class="article-content">
                <p>The 2024 Cadillac Vistiq marks a significant evolution in Cadillac's SUV lineup, offering a perfect blend of luxury, technology, and performance. During our exclusive first drive, the Vistiq demonstrated why it's positioned to be a standout in the competitive luxury SUV segment.</p>
                
                <p>Powered by a robust 3.6-liter V6 engine paired with a smooth 9-speed automatic transmission, the Vistiq delivers 335 horsepower and 271 lb-ft of torque. This powertrain provides confident acceleration and passing power, while maintaining reasonable fuel economy for its class.</p>
                
                <p>Inside, the Vistiq showcases Cadillac's commitment to premium materials and cutting-edge technology. The cabin features hand-stitched leather, genuine wood trim, and a 38-inch curved OLED display that spans most of the dashboard. This intuitive interface houses both the digital instrument cluster and the infotainment system, which includes wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration.</p>
                
                <p>Ride quality is exceptional, with the adaptive suspension soaking up road imperfections while maintaining composure through corners. Road and wind noise are minimal, creating a serene environment for both short commutes and long road trips.</p>
                
                <p>The Vistiq also impresses with its comprehensive suite of driver assistance technologies, including Super Cruise hands-free driving capability on compatible highways, a feature that continues to set Cadillac apart from many competitors.</p>
                
                <p>With pricing starting at $65,995 for the base Luxury trim and reaching $78,795 for the top-tier Platinum model, the 2024 Cadillac Vistiq represents strong value in the luxury SUV segment, especially considering its feature set and refinement level.</p>
                
                <p>In conclusion, the 2024 Cadillac Vistiq successfully delivers on Cadillac's promise of American luxury with a modern twist. It stands as a compelling alternative to established European and Japanese luxury SUVs, offering a distinctive design, comfortable driving experience, and impressive technology package.</p>

            <div class="byline">BY JANE SMITH | MAY 5, 2023</div>
            
            <div class="article-body">
                <p>Cadillac's newest SUV offering, the 2024 Vistiq, slides into the lineup between the XT6 and Escalade, creating a compelling option for luxury SUV buyers seeking spaciousness without the full-size footprint of the flagship Escalade.</p>
                
                <p>In our instrumented testing, the Vistiq's 3.6-liter V6 propelled it from 0-60 mph in 6.2 seconds – respectable performance for a vehicle weighing just over 4,500 pounds. More impressive was the linear power delivery and refined character of the powertrain, which maintains Cadillac's reputation for smooth operation.</p>
                
                <p>On our 200-mile highway fuel economy test, the Vistiq returned 24 mpg, slightly better than its EPA estimate and competitive within its segment. The standard all-wheel-drive system provides sure-footed traction without significantly penalizing efficiency.</p>
                
                <p>The interior deserves special mention for its exceptional attention to detail. The semi-aniline leather seats with 20-way adjustment provide outstanding comfort for long journeys. Second-row passengers enjoy nearly as much luxury, with heated and ventilated captain's chairs, while the third row can accommodate adults for shorter trips.</p>
                
                <p>Cadillac's latest infotainment system is displayed on a curved 38-inch OLED panel that combines digital instruments and touchscreen controls. The interface is responsive and logically organized, though some functions require multiple inputs where physical buttons might be more efficient.</p>
                
                <p>Dynamically, the Vistiq prioritizes comfort over sportiness, with a plush ride that filters out road imperfections admirably. The steering is appropriately weighted but doesn't provide much feedback. This isn't a driver's SUV like the BMW X5, but it excels at its intended purpose of luxurious transportation.</p>
                
                <p>With a base price of $65,995 and our well-equipped test vehicle coming in at $76,285, the Vistiq represents solid value in the luxury midsize SUV segment. It's a worthy addition to Cadillac's portfolio and should appeal to buyers seeking distinctive American luxury with modern technology.</p>
