# Diagnosing Stuck Process - Timestamp Issue

## The Problem
- Render logs show activity but all timestamps are frozen at logout time
- Database shows INACTIVE (no new clips being added)
- Process appears to be running but not making progress

## This Usually Means One of These Issues:

### 1. **Process is Stuck in a Retry Loop**
The process might be hitting an error and retrying the same work order repeatedly without progressing to new ones.

### 2. **Database Connection Lost**
The process lost connection to Supabase when the UI logged out, so it's processing but can't save results.

### 3. **Rate Limiting or API Issues**
The process might be stuck waiting for rate limits or API responses.

## Quick Diagnosis Queries

Run these in Supabase to understand what's happening:

### 1. Check Last Successful Clips
```sql
-- See the last 10 clips that were successfully processed
SELECT 
    wo_number,
    make,
    model,
    status,
    processed_date,
    tier_used
FROM clips
ORDER BY processed_date DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 2. Check for Repeated Attempts
```sql
-- Look for work orders with multiple recent attempts (retry loops)
SELECT 
    wo_number,
    COUNT(*) as attempt_count,
    MAX(processed_date) as last_attempt,
    STRING_AGG(DISTINCT status, ', ') as statuses
FROM clips
WHERE processed_date > NOW() - INTERVAL '2 hours'
GROUP BY wo_number
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```

### 3. Check Processing Gaps
```sql
-- Find time gaps in processing (where it might have gotten stuck)
WITH clip_times AS (
    SELECT 
        processed_date,
        LAG(processed_date) OVER (ORDER BY processed_date) as prev_processed_date
    FROM clips
    WHERE processed_date > NOW() - INTERVAL '2 hours'
)
SELECT 
    prev_processed_date as stopped_at,
    processed_date as resumed_at,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (processed_date - prev_processed_date))/60 as gap_minutes
FROM clip_times
WHERE processed_date - prev_processed_date > INTERVAL '5 minutes'
ORDER BY processed_date DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## Common Fixes

### If Process is Stuck:
1. **Stop the current process** in Render
2. **Check the last successful work order** using the queries above
3. **Restart from the next work order** to skip the problematic one

### If Database Connection Lost:
- The process needs to be restarted to re-establish connection
- Check if your Supabase connection has any limits or timeouts

### If Rate Limited:
- Check which tier was being used when it got stuck
- May need to wait or switch to a different escalation tier

## Prevention for Future Runs

1. **Add Progress Logging**: Log to a file or separate table every N work orders
2. **Implement Heartbeat**: Update a timestamp in the database periodically
3. **Add Skip Logic**: After X retries, skip problematic work orders
4. **Session Management**: Handle database reconnection if session expires

## The Timestamp Mystery

The frozen timestamps in Render logs suggest the logging buffer isn't flushing properly. This can happen when:
- The process is stuck in a tight loop
- Output buffering is enabled and not flushing
- The process is waiting indefinitely for something

Check the actual Render log content (not just timestamps) to see if it's repeating the same operations.
