# Enhanced Date Filtering Update

## ðŸš€ Docker Container Updated Successfully

The DriveShop Clip Docker container has been updated with enhanced date filtering capabilities.

### New Features Added:

#### 1. **YouTube Relative Date Parser** (`src/utils/youtube_relative_date_parser.py`)
- Parses YouTube's relative date strings (e.g., "2 days ago", "3 months ago")
- Integrated into ScrapFly parsing to extract dates during video discovery
- Also extracts dates when fetching video metadata

#### 2. **Platform-Aware Date Filtering** (`src/utils/enhanced_date_filter.py`)
- **YouTube**: Accepts content without dates (since extraction is unreliable)
- **TikTok/Instagram**: Accepts with caution
- **Web articles**: Rejects without dates (likely old content)
- **Absolute age limit**: 18 months maximum
- **Loan window**: 60 days before to 180 days after loan start date

#### 3. **Smart URL Analysis**
- Detects old content from URL patterns (e.g., /2020/article)
- Catches archive/cached pages
- Works even when publication date can't be extracted

### What This Solves:

âœ… **Prevents very old clips** (1-4 years old) from being accepted  
âœ… **Preserves good YouTube content** that lacks extractable dates  
âœ… **Rejects old web articles** without determinable dates  
âœ… **Maintains flexibility** for re-issued loans (60-day buffer)  

### Container Access:

- **Dashboard URL**: http://localhost:8501
- **Container Name**: driveshop-clip
- **Status**: Running âœ…

### Files Modified:

1. `src/utils/youtube_relative_date_parser.py` (NEW)
2. `src/utils/enhanced_date_filter.py` (NEW)
3. `src/utils/youtube_handler.py` (Updated to extract dates)
4. `src/ingest/ingest.py` (Updated to use enhanced filtering)

### Next Steps:

1. Monitor the system to ensure old clips are properly filtered
2. Check that good YouTube content is still being accepted
3. Review any clips flagged for manual date verification
4. Adjust thresholds if needed (currently 18 months max age)
