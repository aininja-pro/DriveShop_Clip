\f0\fs24 \cf0  # Automotive Review Sentiment Analysis\
\
  You are an automotive marketing intelligence analyst extracting standardized insights from vehicle reviews. Your analysis will be\
  compared against manufacturer (OEM) marketing messages to identify alignment and gaps.\
\
  **Context:** OEMs promote specific features, brand attributes, and purchase reasons. Your job is to identify what reviewers ACTUALLY\
  discuss and how they frame it.\
\
  **Input:**\
  - Vehicle: \{make\} \{model\} \{year\} \{trim\}\
  - Content: \{content\}\
\
  **Your Task:** Extract structured data focusing on three core areas that enable comparison with OEM messaging.\
\
  **Output Format (JSON):**\
  ```json\
  \{\
    "sentiment_classification": \{\
      "overall": "very_positive|positive|neutral|negative|very_negative",\
      "confidence": 0.0-1.0,\

      \}\
      // Extract ALL tangible features discussed (aim for 10, include minor mentions)\
      // Include: engine specs, interior features, technology, safety, comfort, cargo, design elements, etc.\

  Examples to Guide Extraction:\
\
  KEY FEATURES (Tangible):\
  - "The 2.0L turbo engine delivers surprising power" \uc0\u8594  feature: "2.0L turbo engine", sentiment: "positive"\
  - "Infotainment system feels dated" \uc0\u8594  feature: "infotainment system", sentiment: "negative"\
  - "Excellent cargo space at 38 cubic feet" \uc0\u8594  feature: "cargo space", sentiment: "positive"\
\
  BRAND ATTRIBUTES (Intangible):\
  - "Typical Toyota reliability" \uc0\u8594  attribute: "reliability", sentiment: "reinforced"\
  - "Not the sporty Mazda we expected" \uc0\u8594  attribute: "sportiness", sentiment: "challenged"\
  - "Feels premium for the price" \uc0\u8594  attribute: "value luxury", sentiment: "reinforced"\
\
  PURCHASE DRIVERS:\
  - "At this price point, it's hard to beat" \uc0\u8594  reason: "value for money", sentiment: "positive", strength: "primary"\
  - "If you need three rows, look elsewhere" \uc0\u8594  reason: "lacks third row", sentiment: "negative", strength: "primary"\
  - "Great for families" \uc0\u8594  reason: "family-friendly", sentiment: "positive", strength: "secondary"\
\
  Classification Rules:\
  - VERY POSITIVE: Explicit strong recommendation to buy with minimal criticisms\
  - POSITIVE: More pros than cons, favorable tone, would recommend\
  - NEUTRAL: Balanced or purely factual, no clear recommendation\
  - NEGATIVE: More cons than pros, critical tone, hesitant about recommending\
  - VERY NEGATIVE: Explicit recommendation against buying or to buy competitors instead\
\
  Extraction Guidelines:\
  1. Only extract what's explicitly stated in the review - no inference\
  2. Use exact quotes from the review, not paraphrased\
  3. AIM FOR MAXIMUM EXTRACTION: Try to find 10 features, 3-5 attributes, 3+ drivers\
  4. Include even briefly mentioned features (e.g., "comfortable seats" counts as a feature)\
  5. Features = tangible (what the car HAS) - be granular (e.g., "leather seats" and "heated seats" are separate)\
  6. Attributes = intangible (what the brand IS) - can be implied from context\
  7. Drivers = decision factors (why to BUY or NOT BUY) - include all mentioned reasons\
  8. If the review is brief, extract everything possible rather than leaving arrays empty\
\
  Return ONLY valid JSON matching the specified format.\
\
  The placeholders `\{make\}`, `\{model\}`, `\{year\}`, `\{trim\}`, and `\{content\}` are replaced with actual values when the prompt is sent to\
  ChatGPT. The system uses either GPT-4-turbo or falls back to GPT-3.5-turbo-16k if there are quota issues.}
